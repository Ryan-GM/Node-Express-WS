Hello, this is a sample text file.
Node.js is reading this file asynchronously.

This file contains multiple lines of text,
designed to demonstrate how Node.js handles file I/O operations.
By reading this file, you can see how asynchronous operations 
in Node.js do not block the execution of other tasks.

This is the end of the sample text. Happy coding!
