Asynchronous Programming: Node.js uses asynchronous, non-blocking I/O by default, 
which allows it to handle many tasks at once without waiting for each task to complete. 
This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, such as reading files, querying databases, 
or making network requests.

Callback Functions: Node.js often uses callbacks to handle the result of asynchronous operations. 
In the fs.readFile example, the callback function is called once the file reading is complete, 
either with an error or with the file data.

Event Loop: The Node.js event loop continuously checks for tasks that have completed (like the file read operation) and then 
invokes the corresponding callback functions.
